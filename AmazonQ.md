# Memory Leak Fixes in letgofur

This document outlines the memory leak issues identified in the letgofur repository and the fixes implemented to address them.

## Issues Identified

1. **Unclosed HTTP Response Bodies**
   - HTTP response bodies were not properly closed in all error paths
   - `log.Fatal()` was used which would terminate the program without proper cleanup

2. **No Timeout Handling for HTTP Requests**
   - The code used `http.DefaultClient` without timeouts
   - Long-running requests could lead to goroutine leaks

3. **Unbounded Memory Usage in Log Retrieval**
   - Log data was read into memory all at once using `io.ReadAll()`
   - Large logs could consume excessive memory

4. **Large Batch Processing in initworkspace.go**
   - All app configurations were processed at once
   - For large CapRover instances, this could lead to high memory usage

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Added Custom HTTP Client with Timeouts**
   - Created a custom HTTP client with a 30-second timeout
   - Added the client as a field in the Caprover struct

2. **Added Context Support for Request Cancellation**
   - Replaced `http.NewRequest()` with `http.NewRequestWithContext()`
   - Added context with timeout for all HTTP requests

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Replaced `log.Fatal()` with proper error returns
   - Added detailed error messages with `fmt.Errorf()`
   - Ensured response bodies are closed in all code paths

4. **Limited Memory Usage for Log Retrieval**
   - Added a size limit (10MB) for log data using `io.LimitReader()`
   - Prevents excessive memory consumption for large logs

5. **Batch Processing for App Configurations**
   - Modified `initworkspace.go` to process apps in batches
   - Reduces peak memory usage when handling many applications

## Testing

To verify these fixes:

1. Run the application with memory profiling:
   ```go
   go run -memprofile=mem.prof main.go
   ```

2. Analyze the memory profile:
   ```
   go tool pprof mem.prof
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. **Streaming API for Logs**
   - Implement a streaming API for log retrieval
   - Allow clients to process logs incrementally

2. **Connection Pooling**
   - Optimize HTTP client connection pooling settings
   - Reuse connections for better performance

3. **Pagination for App Listing**
   - Add support for paginated app listing
   - Further reduce memory usage for large CapRover instances
