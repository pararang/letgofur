# letgofur Workflows

This document outlines the recommended workflows for managing your CapRover applications with letgofur.

## Workflow 1: Centralized Management (Available Now)

The first workflow involves managing all your CapRover applications in a single folder or repository. This approach provides a centralized view of your entire infrastructure.

### How It Works

1. **Initialize Your Workspace**
   ```bash
   letgofur --host https://captain.your.domain --passwd yourpassword init
   ```
   This creates a directory structure based on your CapRover hostname containing YAML files for all your applications.

2. **Directory Structure**
   ```
   captain.your.domain/
   ├── app1.yml
   ├── app2.yml
   ├── app3.yml
   └── ...
   ```

3. **Version Control**
   - Commit this directory to a Git repository
   - Track changes to your infrastructure over time
   - Collaborate with team members through pull requests

4. **Update Applications**
   - Modify the YAML files to adjust resources, instances, etc.
   - Apply changes using the `apply` command:
     ```bash
     letgofur --host https://captain.your.domain --passwd yourpassword apply app1.yml
     ```

5. **Benefits**
   - Single source of truth for all application configurations
   - Easy to see resource allocation across all applications
   - Simplified backup and restoration of configurations
   - Consistent infrastructure management

## Workflow 2: Embedded Configuration (Coming Soon)

The second workflow will allow embedding the YAML configuration directly within each application's repository. This approach follows the "configuration as code" principle where the infrastructure definition lives alongside the application code.

### How It Will Work

1. **Per-Repository Configuration**
   - Each application repository will contain its own CapRover configuration file
   - Typically placed in the root directory or in a `.caprover/` folder

2. **Example Structure**
   ```
   your-app-repo/
   ├── src/
   ├── package.json
   ├── Dockerfile
   ├── captain-definition
   └── caprover.yml  # letgofur configuration
   ```

3. **Deployment Integration**
   - CI/CD pipelines can apply the configuration during deployment
   - Configuration changes are versioned alongside code changes

4. **Benefits**
   - Configuration travels with the application code
   - Developers can update infrastructure needs alongside code changes
   - Clear ownership of configuration
   - Easier to maintain application-specific requirements

## Choosing a Workflow

- **Workflow 1** is ideal for DevOps teams managing multiple applications
- **Workflow 2** will be better for development teams focused on specific applications
- Both workflows can be combined based on organizational needs

Stay tuned for updates as we implement Workflow 2 in future releases of letgofur!
